### Personal Intro
Hi! I am a fourth-year student majoring in Statistics and Data Science as well as Global Studies at UCLA. After my graduation in June 2024, I will pursue a master degree in Data Science. At the same time, I am open to intern and full-time job opportunities. I am especially interested in roles like data analyst and data scientist. I believe my knowledge in machine learning, predictive analysis, data mining, sentiment analysis, alongside my skill sets in R, SQL, and Python, would make me a competitive candidate for these positions. Feel free to contact me!
